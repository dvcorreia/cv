# My CV/Résumé

This is a fork of v1.3.2 (17 May 2020) of [AltaCV](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV) by [LianTze Lim](https://github.com/liantze) LianTze Lim (liantze@gmail.com) modified for my needs

Refer to [AltaCV](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV) original repository for more information

    Changes: 
    - Small changes in spacings and font sizes
    - Overall section organization
    - Colors

## Requirements and Compilation

* pdflatex + biber + pdflatex
* AltaCV uses [`fontawesome5`](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontawesome5) and [`academicons`](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/academicons); they're included in both TeX Live 2016 and MikTeX 2.9.
* Loading `academicons` is optional: enable it by adding the `academicons` option to `\documentclass`.
* Use the `normalphoto` option to get normal (i.e. non-circular) photos.
* As of v1.2 you can add multiple photos on the left or right: `\photoL{2cm}{logo1}` and `\photoR{2.5cm}{logo2,photo}`. (`\photo` will work like `\photoR`.) Separate your image filenames with commas _without_ spaces.
* Use the `ragged2d` option to activate hyphenations while keeping text left-justified; line endings will thus be less jagged and more aesthetically pleasing.
* As of v1.3 the `withhyper` document class option will make the "personal info" fields into clickable hyperlinks (where it makes sense). See below for more details.
* Can now be compiled with pdflatex, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX!
* However if you're using `academicons`, you _must_ use either XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. If the doc then compiles but the icons don't show up in the output PDF, try compiling with LuaLaTeX instead.
* The samples here use the [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) and [Roboto Slab fonts](https://github.com/googlefonts/robotoslab). Feel free to use a different typeface package instead—often a different typeface will change the entire CV's feel.

## Clickable Info fields

As of v1.3, the `withhyper` document class option will load the `hyperref` package, and make fields in the personal detail fields into clickable hyperlinks (where it makes sense anyway).

*BIG CAVEAT:* Remember that not all readers may want to click on hyperlinks in PDFs. You may therefore sometimes want to _remove_ `withhyper`, and spell out the field URL details a bit more completely, e.g. `\github{github.com/your-id}`.

Anyway assuming that you _do_ keep `withhyper` enabled: For each field e.g. `\homepage{foobar.com}`, a `\homepagesymbol` has been defined, and the clickable hyperlink is generated by prepending the `\homepagehyperprefix` to `foobar.com`. The `\homepgehyperprefix` is defined to be `\https://`, so this generates the hyperlink `https://foobar.com`.

If your homepage doesn't use HTTPS yet, or if you want to use a different symbol, you can re-define them with
```latex
\renewcommand{\homepagehyperprefix}{http://}
\renewcommand{\homepagesymbol}{\faLink}
```


## New Information Fields ####

I've decided against adding definitions for too many fields and symbols in the `.cls` itself; otherwise we'll have all possible platforms in the world (and more services are born everyday!) within `altacv.cls` before we know it.

You can actually just typeset your own arbitrary information fields using the `\printinfo{symbol}{detail}[optional hyperlink prefix]` command within `\personalinfo`:

````latex
\printinfo{\faPaw}{Hey ho!}
\printinfo{\faGitLab}{your-handle}[https://gitlab.com/]
````

Or if you really prefer, you can define a new field yourself with `\NewInfoFiled{fieldname}{symbol}[optional hyperlink prefix]` before  using it:

````latex
\NewInfoField{gitlab}{\faGitlab}[https://gitlab.com/]
\gitlab{your_id}
````

## Configurable colours

Use `\colorlet` or `\definecolor` to change these.
* `accent`
* `emphasis`
* `heading`
* `headingrule`
* `subheading`
* `body`
* `name`
* `tagline`

## Configurable fonts

Use `\renewcommand` to change these.
* `\namefont`
* `\taglinefont`
* `\personalinfofont`
* `\cvsectionfont`
* `\cvsubsectionfont`
